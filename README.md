# BusinessOOP

Hello!
Thank you for reading me! this repository consists of 3 data visualization projects 
I completed in my Object Oriented Programming for Business Applications course.
- Linear Regression
- Pie Charts, Bar Graphs
- Decision Tree and Confusion Matrix

Our datasets were pulled from Kaggle.com on separate topics:
- Global Maritime Attacks
- Earthquake Data from STEAD
- Heart Attacks

Creating Data visualizations on separate topics was great to experience the flexibility and freedom that come with programming
our data visualizations where I learned:
- What features to pursue further information from
- heat maps and their correlations within the dataset
- Different libraries and graphics we can develop for data visualization in both and informative and visually appealing way
